- Deprecated the `DataRequest.getVersion()` method.
- Deprecated the `DataRequest.withVersion()` method.
- Changed the `VersionedLayerClient.getData` and `VersionedLayerClient.getPartitions` methods. Now, they ignore versions from `DataRequest` and `PartitionsRequest` and use versions from the `VersionedLayerClient` instance. If you initialize `VersionedLayerClient` without any version, on the first call, the latest version is fetched from the service and set in the instance.
- Added the `SubscribeRequest` class. This is used by `StreamLayerClient.subscribe()`.
- Deprecated the `StatisticsRequest.withDatalevel()` method with a string parameter and added the `StatisticsRequest.withDatalevel()` method with a number parameter.

With the `seek` method, you can set to start reading messages from a stream layer at any given position.
- Added the `PollRequest` class. It is used by `StreamLayerClient.poll()`.
- Added the `UnsubscribeRequest` class. It is used by `StreamLayerClient.unsubscribe()`.

- Added the `IndexLayerClient` constructor that creates the `IndexLayerClientClient` instance using the `IndexLayerClientClientParams` object.
- Changed the `LookupAPI.getBaseUrl()` method. Now, you can fetch all URLs in one request instead of fetching each URL separately.
- Changed the `ConfigClient.getCatalogs()` method. Now, the `request` parameter is optional.
