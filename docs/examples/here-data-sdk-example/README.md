# Getting Started with React App and Here Data SDK for Typescript.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run

1) Copy ./public/credentials.json.sample to ./public/credentials.json and add your credentials to that file. [See more](https://developer.here.com/documentation/sdk-typescript/dev_guide/topics/authenticate.html).

2) Run `yarn` to fetch dependencies.

3) Run `yarn start` to run app in development mode.

4) Open in your favorite browser `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
