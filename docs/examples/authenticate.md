# Authenticate to the HERE Platform

You can use an access token to authenticate to the HERE platform and start working with HERE Data SDK for Typescript.

**To get an access token:**

1. Get your platform credentials.

   For instructions, see the [Get Credentials](https://developer.here.com/olp/documentation/access-control/user-guide/topics/get-credentials.html) section in the Terms and Permissions User Guide.

   You get the `credentials.properties` file.

2. Set your credentials in one of the following ways:

   - (For Node.js only) Get your credentials from the file using the `loadCredentialsFromFile` helper method.

     ```typescript
     const credentials = loadCredentialsFromFile("Path");
     ```

   - (For browser and Node.js) Set credentials manually using the **here.access.key.Ñ–d** and **here.access.key.secret** from the `credentials.properties` file.

     ```typescript
     const credentials = {
       accessKeyId: "replace-with-your-access-key-id",
       accessKeySecret: "replace-with-your-access-key-secret",
     };
     ```

3. Import the `requestToken` method and the `UserAuth` module from the `olp-sdk-authentication` module.

   ```typescript
   import { UserAuth, requestToken } from "@here/olp-sdk-authentication";
   ```

4. Create the `UserAuth` instance in one of the following ways:

   - For token authentication, specify the `tokenRequester` method and your credentials.

     ```typescript
     const userAuth = new UserAuth({
       tokenRequester: requestToken,
       credentials: credentials,
     });
     ```

   - To authenticate with local authorization, specify the environment in which you work, your credentials, and the `tokenRequester` method.

     > Note: Depending on the environment that you use, specify one of the following parameters: `env` or `customUrl`.

     ```typescript
     const userAuth = new UserAuth({
       env: "here | here-dev | here-cn | here-cn-dev",
       customUrl: "http://YourCustomEnvironment",
       credentials: credentials,
       tokenRequester: requestToken,
     });
     ```

   - For project authentication, specify the `tokenRequester` method, your project name, and credentials.

   ```typescript
     const userAuth = new UserAuth({
       tokenRequester: requestToken,
       scope: "your-project-name"
       credentials: credentials,
     });
   ```

5. Get the OAuth 2.0 token from the HERE platform using the `getToken` method.

   ```typescript
   const token: string = await userAuth.getToken();
   ```

You can now use the access token to create the `OlpClientSettings` object and work with layers. The token expires after an hour. To always have a valid access token when you get or publish data, use the `UserAuth` instance with the `getToken` method to create the `OlpClientSettings` object.
