# Get started with the React App and HERE Data SDK for Typescript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run the app

1. Copy `./public/credentials.json.sample` to `./public/credentials.json`, and then add your credentials to that file.
    
    For more information, see the [related section](https://developer.here.com/documentation/sdk-typescript/dev_guide/topics/authenticate.html) in our Developer Guide.

2. To fetch dependencies, run `yarn && yarn add react-scripts`.

3. To run the app in the development mode, run `yarn start`.

4. In your favorite browser, open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `yarn start` – runs the app in the development mode.\
    To view it in the browser, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    The page reloads if you make edits.\
    You will also see no lint errors in the console.

- `yarn build` – builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
    It correctly bundles React in the production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
    Your app is ready to be deployed. For more information on deployment, see the [related section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation.
