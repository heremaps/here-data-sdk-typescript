# Examples

HERE Data SDK for TypeScript contains several examples that demonstrate some of the key use cases:

- [Authorization example](https://github.com/heremaps/here-data-sdk-typescript/tree/master/examples/authorization-example) – build the Data SDK using webpack and work with the APIs from `@here/olp-sdk-dataservice-api`. You can use this example application to find the list of groups that you have access to as well as create groups.
- [React App example](https://github.com/heremaps/here-data-sdk-typescript/tree/master/examples/react-app-example) – use the Data SDK and React in a browser and learn how to work with the following modules: `olp-sdk-authentication`, `olp-sdk-dataservice-read`, and `olp-sdk-dataservice-write`.
- [Node.js example](https://github.com/heremaps/here-data-sdk-typescript/tree/master/examples/nodejs-example) – work with the Data SDK in Node.js and learn how to get data from versioned layers and save it to files.
- [MultiPartUploadWrapper example](https://github.com/heremaps/here-data-sdk-typescript/blob/master/examples/multipart-upload-wrapper-example) – use the Data SDK to upload and publish a large amount of data in a browser.
